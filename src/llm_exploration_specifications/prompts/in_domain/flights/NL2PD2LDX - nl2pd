LDX is an extension to python pandas. Instead of explicitly passing the parameters
to the pandas built-in methods (e.g groupby), it allows you use continuity variables (placeholders), which are determined during runtime.
The extension is especially useful for specifying the order of notebook's query operations and their type and parameters.
The continuity variables stores its value in order to reuse the same value in several places.
LDX currently supports only the following operations: filter, groupby, agg.

here are some basic examples how to convert tasks to LDX:

task: apply twice the same aggregation and same groupby
LDX:
       agg = df.groupby(<COL>).agg(<AGG>)
       same_agg = df.groupby(<COL>).agg(<AGG>)

task: apply two different aggregations, both grouped by the same column
LDX:
        agg1 = df.groupby(<COL>).agg(<AGG1>)
        agg2 = df.groupby(<COL>).agg(<AGG2>)

task: group by separately by two different columns, both aggregated with the same aggregation
LDX:
        groupby1 = df.groupby(<COL1>).agg(<AGG>)
        groupby2 = df.groupby(<COL2>).agg(<AGG>)

task: apply two completely different aggregations
LDX:
        agg1 = df.groupby(<COL1>).agg(<AGG1>)
        agg2 = df.groupby(<COL2>).agg(<AGG2>)

task: filter attribute ATT to some value
LDX:
      some_origin_airport = df[df['ATT'] == <VALUE>]

task: make sure at some point to filter attribute ATT to some value, there might be other operations before that.
LDX:
      do_some_operations()
      some_origin_airport = df[df['ATT'] == <VALUE>]

here are more complex examples how to convert tasks to LDX, given from_boston.tsv dataset, scheme ['flight_id', 'airline', 'origin_airport', 'destination_airport', 'flight_number', 'delay_reason', 'departure_delay', 'scheduled_trip_time', 'scheduled_departure', 'scheduled_arrival', 'day_of_week', 'day_of_month', 'month'] and sample:
  flight_id airline origin_airport destination_airport  flight_number delay_reason departure_delay scheduled_trip_time scheduled_departure scheduled_arrival  day_of_week  day_of_month  month

task: find one flight delay reason which has one different property compared to all the other flight delay reasons

LDX:
    df = pd.read_csv("from_boston.tsv", delimiter="	")

    some_delay_reason = df[df['delay_reason'] == <VALUE>]
    other_delay_reason = df[df['delay_reason'] != <VALUE>]

    some_delay_reason_agg = some_delay_reason.groupby(<COL>).agg(<AGG>)
    other_delay_reason_agg = other_delay_reason.groupby(<COL>).agg(<AGG>)

explanation: Split the flights to two sets - one with a certain delay reason origin airport and one the other delay reasons.
Then apply the same aggregation on both of them in order to compare them.

task: investigate what makes flights to have large delay and drill down to a specific reason

LDX:
    df = pd.read_csv("from_boston.tsv", delimiter="	")
    large_delay_flights = df[df['delay_duration'] == LARGE_DELAY]
    flights_properties1 = large_delay_flights.groupby(<COL1>).agg(<AGG1>)
    focus_of_col1 = large_delay_flights[large_delay_flights[<COL1>] == <VALUE1>]
    flights_properties2 = focus_of_col1.groupby(<COL2>).agg(<AGG2>)
    focus_of_col2 = focus_of_col1[focus_of_col1[<COL2>] == <VALUE2>]

explanation: filter the flights for those with large delay.
Then, group according to some column and apply some aggregation in order to find some column that significantly influences the distribution of those flights.
After that filter on one of the values of the selected column from the previous step. Repeat it once again to drill down more.

task: compare some three different subsets of delay reasons of flights according to some properties

LDX:
    df = pd.read_csv("from_boston.tsv", delimiter="	")

    first_delay_reason = df[df['delay_reason'] == <VALUE1>]
    second_delay_reason = df[df['delay_reason'] == <VALUE2>]
    third_delay_reason = df[df['delay_reason'] == <VALUE3>]

    first_delay_reason_agg = first_delay_reason.groupby(<COL>).agg(<AGG>)
    second_delay_reason_agg = second_delay_reason.groupby(<COL>).agg(<AGG>)
    third_delay_reason_agg = third_delay_reason.groupby(<COL>).agg(<AGG>)

explanation: Split the flights to three sets, each one filtered to a different delay reasons.
Then apply the same aggregation on each of them in order to compare them.

task: show the average departure delay of some two different subsets of flights

LDX:
    df = pd.read_csv("from_boston.tsv", delimiter="	")

    first_subset = df[df[<COL1>] == <VALUE1>]
    first_subset_agg = first_subset.groupby(<AGG_COL1>).agg({'departure_delay': 'mean'})

    second_subset = df[df[<COL2] == <VALUE2>]
    second_subset_agg = second_subset.groupby(<AGG_COL2>).agg({'departure_delay': 'mean'})

explanation: filter the flights to some column and some of its values.
Then, group the flights according to some column and calculate the average departure delay. Do so one more time but on different subset of the flights.

task: show two properties of flights with departure delay compared to all the flights

LDX:
    df = pd.read_csv("from_boston.tsv", delimiter="	")

    flights_properties_1 = df.groupby(<COL1>).agg(<AGG1>)
    flights_properties_2 = df.groupby(<COL2>).agg(<AGG2>)

    flights_with_departure_delay = df[df['departure_delay'] != 'ON_TIME']
    flights_with_departure_delay_properties1 = flights_with_departure_delay.groupby(<COL1>).agg(<AGG1>)
    flights_with_departure_delay_properties2 = flights_with_departure_delay.groupby(<COL2>).agg(<AGG2>)

explanation: Apply two aggregations. Also filter the original data to flights didn't depart on time and apply the same two aggregations in order to compare it to the previous step.

task: explore three different origin airports in different ways

LDX:
    df = pd.read_csv("from_boston.tsv", delimiter="	")

    flights_origin_airport1 = df[df['origin_airport'] == <VALUE1>]
    flights_origin_airport2 = df[df['origin_airport'] == <VALUE2>]
    flights_origin_airport3 = df[df['origin_airport'] == <VALUE3>]

    flights_origin_airport1_properties = flights_origin_airport1.groupby(<COL1>).agg(<AGG1>)
    flights_origin_airport2_properties = flights_origin_airport2.groupby(<COL2>).agg(<AGG2>)
    flights_origin_airport3_properties = flights_origin_airport3.groupby(<COL3>).agg(<AGG3>)

explanation: filter to three different origin airports and for each one show some properties.

task: explore the data, make sure to address two interesting properties of flights with month equals 7

LDX:
    df = pd.read_csv("from_boston.tsv", delimiter="	")

    do_some_operations()

    july_flights = df[df['month'] == 7]

    july_flights_properties_1 = july_flights.groupby(<COL1>).agg(<AGG1>)
    july_flights_properties_2 = july_flights.groupby(<COL2>).agg(<AGG2>)

explanation: do some operations and at in some point filter month to July. Then, show two different properties using two different group by operations.

task: show interesting sub-groups of flights to JFK

LDX:
    df = pd.read_csv("from_boston.tsv", delimiter="	")

    jfk_flights = df[df['destination_airport'] == 'JFK']

    jfk_agg = jfk_flights.groupby(<COL1>).agg(<AGG1>)

    jfk_sub_agg = jfk_agg.groupby(<COL2>).agg(<AGG2>)

explanation: Filter to flights JFK as destination airport.
Then apply some groupby to view it as interesting groups, and apply another different groupby to view interesting sub-groups.

now convert the following task to LDX according to the given scheme, and add explanation.

task:
