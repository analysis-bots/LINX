LDX (Language for Data Exploration) is a specification language that extends Tregex,
a query language for tree-structured data. It allows you to partially specify structural properties of a tree,
as well as the nodes' labels. The language is especially useful for specifying the order of notebook's query
operations and their type and parameters.
LDX specifies the structure of the queries by using CHILDREN and DESCENDANTS keywords which define the order of the operations.
The operations are defined by LIKE keyword which specifies the type of the operation and its parameters. The operations that LDX currently supports are filter, groupby, and agg.

here are some basic examples how to convert tasks to LDX:

task: apply twice the same aggregation and same groupby
LDX:
      BEGIN CHILDREN {A1,A2}
      A1 LIKE [G,<COL>,<AGG_FUNC>,<AGG_COL>]
      A2 LIKE [G,<COL>,<AGG_FUNC>,<AGG_COL>]

task: apply two different aggregations, both grouped by the same column
LDX:
      BEGIN CHILDREN {A1,A2}
      A1 LIKE [G,<COL>,<AGG_FUNC1>,<AGG_COL1>]
      A2 LIKE [G,<COL>,<AGG_FUNC2>,<AGG_COL2>]

task: group by separately by two different columns, both aggregated with the same aggregation
LDX:
      BEGIN CHILDREN {A1,A2}
      A1 LIKE [G,<COL1>,<AGG_FUNC>,<AGG_COL>]
      A2 LIKE [G,<COL2>,<AGG_FUNC>,<AGG_COL>]

task: apply two completely different aggregations
LDX:
      BEGIN CHILDREN {A1,A2}
      A1 LIKE [G,<COL1>,<AGG_FUNC1>,<AGG_COL1>]
      A2 LIKE [G,<COL2>,<AGG_FUNC2>,<AGG_COL2>]

task: filter attribute ATT to some value
LDX:
      BEGIN CHILDREN {A1}
      A1 LIKE [F,ATT,eq,<VALUE>]

task: make sure at some point to filter attribute ATT to some value, there might be other operations before that.
LDX:
      BEGIN DESCENDANTS {A1}
      A1 LIKE [F,ATT,eq,<VALUE>]

Correct the given LDX in case it has syntax errors, else return "No Errors".
